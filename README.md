# Vettlingr-lite

This is a fork of Vettlingr's Tileset that excludes some mods.  
Here's what's different in this distribution of Vettlingr:

 * Quartz cannot be turned into glass.
 * Anhydrite can only be found in Gypsum.
 * Diamonds cannot be found in Kimberlite.
 * Mushroom "trees" don't have leaves.
 
If you would like to download the full version of Vettlingr 32x with the
above features restored, you can download it from its thread on bay12forums.
